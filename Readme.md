# LocalShopper

## Concept

We want to make a webpage that gives people with no time the ability to shop from home. We want to make this possible by depending on people that have more time during the quarantine. We want to do this by making a website available to both parties on which they can connect and help each other out for a compensation.

## How

* People can log in as people in need and people with time to spare.

* They get connected based on location.

* Users can give each other ratings and reviews.

* ...

## Tools

* Docker

* MySQL

* ...

# Uber Needs

## Concept

We want to make a webpage that gives people with no time the ability to connect with people to complete their daily tasks. we can make this possible by depending on people that have more time during this quarantine, making a website available to both parties on which they can connect and help each other out for a compensation.

## How

* People can log in as people in need and people with time to spare.

* A tab for people who require help, and a tab for people that can help these people out.

* They get connected based on location.

* Corona measures get taken into account for how many people you can help at a time.

* Possible infections can be put into the website and people who were connected get notified.

* Users can give each other ratings and reviews.

* ...

## Tools

* Docker

* MySQL

* ...
